<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Phan Thanh Tuan 👋</h1>

## About me

> ✍ Hello! My name is Tuan, and I work in Cyber ​​Security. I am passionate about protecting digital environments and ensuring data security. I regularly research to identify vulnerabilities, analyze threats, and develop effective strategies to protect networks and systems. With a solid foundation in cybersecurity principles and hands-on experience with tools such as Snort, Msfvenom, Splunk, Volatility 3... and various network analysis tools.

> I actively participate in researching new attack vectors and participate in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions to challenge myself and improve my skills. I also stay up-to-date by researching the latest Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), which helps me understand and mitigate the risks associated with emerging threats. My journey in cybersecurity is driven by a commitment to continuous learning and a desire to contribute to a safer digital world. ✍
